            "question": "💱 Can I use Binance on my own?",
            "answer": "<p>Yes. You can use your Binance account as you normally would — buy, sell, or hold assets on your <b>SPOT balance</b>.</p><p>Once your exchange is connected via API, the system will automatically detect your manual purchases and include those assets in AI trading without any extra steps.</p>"

            "question": "💬 How does trading work in crypto markets? Can I hold assets indefinitely?",
            "answer": "<p>Yes. In crypto markets, you own your assets directly — you can buy and hold them for as long as you want. <b>The market operates 24/7, with no closing hours or trading-day resets</b>.</p><p><b>Unlike Forex or derivatives markets</b>, where brokers often enforce daily trading limits (due to swaps, risk control, and regulatory requirements), there are no forced time limits in crypto trading.</p><p>On crypto exchanges, you can simply buy a coin and hold it for years — that’s considered long-term investing, not active trading.</p>"

            "question": "🔐 How to connect Binance via API?",
            "answer": "<p>To enable automated trading through your Binance account, connect it via API:</p> <ol> <li> <p>On <strong>Binance.com</strong>, click your profile icon (top right) → <strong>API Management</strong>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Create a <strong>new API key</strong>, name it, complete the security verification (email, 2FA), and get your <strong>API Key</strong> and <strong>Secret Key</strong>.</p> <p>⚠️ The Secret Key is shown <strong>only once</strong> — make sure to save it and enter both keys in your <strong>CRYPTOAPI</strong> trading settings.</p> </li> <li> <p>In the Binance API settings, enable <strong>Spot and Margin Trading</strong>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Under <strong>IP Access Restrictions</strong>, whitelist this IP: <code>176.9.166.90</code></p> </li> <li> <p>Transfer enough of your selected <strong>stablecoin</strong> to your <strong>spot balance</strong> and <strong>activate trading</strong>.</p> <p>💰 <strong>Note:</strong> funds must be placed on the <strong>SPOT balance</strong> — otherwise, the system won’t be able to use them.</p> </li> </ol>"

            "question": "💵 What is the minimum amount required for AI trading on Binance?",
            "answer": "<p>Binance API applies different minimum order requirements for each trading pair (minimum order size, price step, quantity step, and minimum notional value in USDT). Because of these restrictions, the AI algorithm cannot place orders below the thresholds defined by the exchange. Additionally, if the account balance is too small, the system will be unable to perform proper portfolio rebalancing, which is an essential part of the strategy.</p><p>For technically correct operation, the AI trading system requires a minimum spot balance of at least 3000 USDT. This is the threshold at which the algorithm can execute basic operations without running into Binance API limits.</p><p>However, to achieve performance comparable to our historical AI trading model – and to enable full functionality, including dynamic rebalancing – a recommended spot balance is 5000 USDT or more.</p>"

Coins that are locked, reserved, or not able to be sold on the public market are coins that can't affect the price and thus should not be allowed to affect the market capitalization as well.</p><p>The method of using the Circulating Supply is analogous to the method of using public float for determining the market capitalization of companies in traditional investing.</p>"

Excludes the riskiest assets, enters at low or mid positions. Average cycle: 7–180 days. Medium frequency — several dozen trades per month.</li> <li><b>Aggressive</b> — higher risk. Works with all assets except TOP-100 high-risk ones, enters at any position, focuses on maximum profit with rebalancing. Average cycle: 15–365 days. High frequency — a few trades per day.
