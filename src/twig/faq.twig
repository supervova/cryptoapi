Coins that are locked, reserved, or not able to be sold on the public market are coins that can't affect the price and thus should not be allowed to affect the market capitalization as well.</p><p>The method of using the Circulating Supply is analogous to the method of using public float for determining the market capitalization of companies in traditional investing.</p>"

It's impossible to determine how much of the volume is fake so we exclude it entirely from the calculations.</p>"
