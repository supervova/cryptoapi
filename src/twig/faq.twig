In crypto markets, you own your assets directly — you can buy and hold them for as long as you want. <b>The market operates 24/7, with no closing hours or trading-day resets</b>.</p><p><b>Unlike Forex or derivatives markets</b>, where brokers often enforce daily trading limits (due to swaps, risk control, and regulatory requirements), there are no forced time limits in crypto trading.</p><p>On crypto exchanges, you can simply buy a coin and hold it for years — that’s considered long-term investing, not active trading.</p>"

Coins that are locked, reserved, or not able to be sold on the public market are coins that can't affect the price and thus should not be allowed to affect the market capitalization as well.</p><p>The method of using the Circulating Supply is analogous to the method of using public float for determining the market capitalization of companies in traditional investing.</p>"

Excludes the riskiest assets, enters at low or mid positions. Average cycle: 7–180 days. Medium frequency — several dozen trades per month.</li> <li><b>Aggressive</b> — higher risk. Works with all assets except TOP-100 high-risk ones, enters at any position, focuses on maximum profit with rebalancing. Average cycle: 15–365 days. High frequency — a few trades per day.
